# 🦀 Learning Rust with _The Rust Programming Language_

This repository documents my **4-week journey** through the official book [**The Rust Programming Language**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), also known as _The Book_. Each folder corresponds to a chapter, named `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, etc., in the same order as the book.
