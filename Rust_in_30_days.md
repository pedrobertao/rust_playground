## ðŸ”¨ Final Rust Project (Days 30â€“32)

### Day 30 â€“ Planning and Setup

- Choose a project type: CLI, API, parser, file watcher, etc.
- Define the scope: input, output, structure
- Create with `cargo new`, configure `Cargo.toml`
- Add crates like `clap`, `serde`, `reqwest`, etc.

### Day 31 â€“ Implementation and Testing

- Write the core logic and functionality
- Handle errors with `Result`, `Option`, and pattern matching
- Write unit and integration tests using `cargo test`

### Day 32 â€“ Refactoring and Documentation

- Organize code into modules (`mod`, `lib.rs`)
- Add documentation comments (`///`)
- Write a README.md with instructions and usage
- Optionally run `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`, and publish on GitHub

## ðŸ§  Tips

- Use [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) for daily exercises.
- Take notes and save code snippets you find useful.
- Keep your project ideas small and focused.

Happy coding crustacean! ðŸš€
