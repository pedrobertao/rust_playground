## Security Considerations

While this is a Rust learning repository, we aim to promote secure development practices. Here are a few things we focus on:

- Safe handling of user input
- Avoiding `unsafe` blocks unless explicitly for learning
- Encouraging use of tools like [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [cargo-audit](https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit)
- Using updated dependencies with `cargo audit`

If you're using code from this repository in production, please conduct your own thorough security review.
